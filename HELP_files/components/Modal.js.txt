The "Modal.js" file contains a React functional component named `Modal`. This component is responsible for rendering a collection of modals based on the provided `data` prop and handling their visibility state.

Here's a summary of its content:

1. **Imports**:
   - Imports `useState` hook from 'react' for managing component state.

2. **Modal Component**:
   - Functional component defined using arrow function syntax.
   - Accepts a prop named `data`.

3. **State Management**:
   - Utilizes the `useState` hook to manage the state of modal visibility (`modalOpen` state variable). This state variable tracks the open state of each modal based on its index.

4. **Toggle Modal Function**:
   - Defines a function named `toggleModal` that toggles the visibility of a specific modal based on its index.
   - Uses the `setModalOpen` function to update the state by flipping the boolean value of the modal's index in the `modalOpen` object.

5. **Rendering Modals**:
   - Maps through the `data` array to generate multiple modal components based on the provided data.
   - For each item in the `data` array, it renders a modal content section.
   - Each modal consists of content such as a title, subtitle, a "View More" button, and additional details.
   - Clicking the "View More" button triggers the `toggleModal` function to show/hide the corresponding modal.

6. **Modal Structure**:
   - Each modal has a title, subtitle, and an expandable section containing more details, which are initially hidden.
   - Clicking on the "View More" button expands the details section.
   - The `active-modal` class is conditionally applied to show or hide a modal based on its corresponding state in the `modalOpen` object.

7. **Styling**:
   - Uses CSS classes like "services__container", "services__content", "services__modal", etc., to structure and style different elements within the modals.

8. **Functionality**:
   - Generates a collection of modals based on the provided data.
   - Manages the visibility of each modal using state management and a toggle function.
   - Allows users to expand and view additional details for each item by clicking the "View More" button.

Overall, the `Modal` component is responsible for creating a set of modals based on the given data and controlling their visibility state, allowing users to view additional details when toggling the modals via the "View More" button.
