The "Skill.js" file comprises a React functional component named `Skill` responsible for rendering a section displaying different skills along with their details.

Here's a summary of its content:

1. **Functional Component**:
   - Defines a functional component named `Skill` that accepts a prop named `data`.

2. **State Management**:
   - Uses the `useState` hook to manage the component's state.
   - `openSection` state: Tracks the currently open section.
   - `openDetails` state: Tracks the currently open skill details within a section.

3. **Toggle Functions**:
   - `toggleSkills`: Toggles the section open or closed based on the index provided.
   - `toggleDetails`: Toggles the display of skill details for a particular skill within a section.

4. **Rendering Skills and Sections**:
   - Maps over the `data` prop, which contains an array of sections and their corresponding skills.
   - Renders sections and their skills dynamically based on the provided data.
   - Each section contains:
     - A header with an icon, title, duration, and arrow icon to toggle the section open or closed.
     - A list of skills with their names, percentages, and a progress bar.
     - Clicking on a skill reveals additional details if available.
     - Details are displayed in a collapsible manner and are shown or hidden based on the user's interaction.

5. **Conditional Rendering**:
   - Uses conditional rendering to show or hide skill details based on the state (`openDetails`).
   - Clicking on a skill displays its details, and clicking it again hides the details.

6. **Purpose**:
   - Renders a grid of sections, each containing skills with their respective percentages and details, allowing users to view and expand/collapse skill details within each section.

7. **Export**:
   - Exports the `Skill` component using the named export syntax, enabling its usage in other parts of the application to display and manage skills and their details.
